	 NOTE: We must restore the current reference position after
	   recursive calls to next.
Three cases for files from older versions of the system:
1) Class has not changed shape, read it straight.
2) Class has changed instance variables (or needs fixup).  Call a particular method to do it.
3) There is a new class instead.  Find it, call a particular method to read.
	All classes used to construct the structures dictionary *itself* need to be in 'steady' and they must not change!  See setStream:"
