randomBitsFromSoundInput: bitCount
	"Answer a positive integer with the given number of random bits of 'noise' from a sound input source. Typically, one would use a microphone or line input as the sound source, although many sound cards have enough thermal noise that you get random low-order sample bits even with no microphone connected. Only the least signficant bit of the samples is used. Since not all sound cards support 16-bits of sample resolution, we use the lowest bit that changes."
