vmParameterAt: parameterIndex
	"parameterIndex is a positive integer corresponding to one of the VM's internal
	parameter/metric registers.  Answer with the current value of that register.
	Fail if parameterIndex has no corresponding register.
	VM parameters are numbered as follows:
		1	end of old-space (0-based, read-only)
		2	end of young-space (read-only)
		3	end of memory (read-only)
		4	allocationCount (read-only)
		5	allocations between GCs (read-write)
		6	survivor count tenuring threshold (read-write)
		7	full GCs since startup (read-only)
		8	total milliseconds in full GCs since startup (read-only)
		9	incremental GCs since startup (read-only)
		10	total milliseconds in incremental GCs since startup (read-only)
		11	tenures of surving objects since startup (read-only)
		12-20 specific to the translating VM
		21	root table size (read-only)
		22	root table overflows since startup (read-only)
		23	bytes of extra memory to reserve for VM buffers, plugins, etc.

		24	memory threshold above which shrinking object memory (rw)
		25	memory headroom when growing object memory (rw)
		26  interruptChecksEveryNms - force an ioProcessEvents every N milliseconds, in case the image  is not calling getNextEvent often (rw)
		27	number of times mark loop iterated for current IGC/FGC (read-only) includes ALL marking
		28	number of times sweep loop iterated  for current IGC/FGC (read-only)
		29	number of times make forward loop iterated for current IGC/FGC (read-only)
		30	number of times compact move loop iterated for current IGC/FGC (read-only)
		31	number of grow memory requests (read-only)
		32	number of shrink memory requests (read-only)
		33	number of root table entries used for current IGC/FGC (read-only)
		34	number of allocations done before current IGC/FGC (read-only)
		35	number of survivor objects after current IGC/FGC (read-only)
		36  millisecond clock when current IGC/FGC completed (read-only)
		37  number of marked objects for Roots of the world, not including Root Table entries for current IGC/FGC (read-only)
		38  milliseconds taken by current IGC  (read-only)
		39  Number of finalization signals for Weak Objects pending when current IGC/FGC completed (read-only)
		40  VM word size - 4 or 8 (read-only)"
