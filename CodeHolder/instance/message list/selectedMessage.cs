selectedMessage
	"Answer a copy of the source code for the selected message.  This generic version is probably actually never reached, since every subclass probably reimplements and does not send to super.  In time, ideally, most, or all, reimplementors would vanish and all would defer instead to a universal version right here.  Everything in good time."
