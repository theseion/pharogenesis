"This awful bit is to ensure that if we have scanned all the text and the last character is a CR that there is a null line at the end of lines. Sometimes this was not happening which caused anomalous selections when selecting all the text. This is implemented as a post-composition fixup because I coul;dn't figure out where to put it in the main logic."
