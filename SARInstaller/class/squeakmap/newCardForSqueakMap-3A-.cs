	versionComment:'v16: same as v16 of SARInstaller for 3.4 but doesn''t include any classes other than SARInstaller.

To be loaded into 3.6 images only. Will de-register the 3.4 version if it''s registered.

Added a default (DWIM) mode in which SAR files that are missing both a preamble and postscript have all their members loaded in a default manner.

Changed the behavior of #extractMemberWithoutPath: to use the same directory as the SAR itself.

Added #extractMemberWithoutPath:inDirectory:

Moved several change set methods to the class side.

Made change set methods work with 3.5 or 3.6a/b

Now supports the following file types:

Projects (with or without construction of a ViewMorph)
Genie gesture dictionaries
Change sets
DVS packages
Monticello packages
Graphics files (loaded as SketchMorphs)
Text files (loaded as text editor windows)
Morph(s) in files

Now keeps track of installed members.'
