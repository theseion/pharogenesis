	"Return a corrected, fully-qualified name for the given file name. If the given name is already a full path (i.e., it contains a delimiter character), assume it is already a fully-qualified name. Otherwise, prefix it with the path to this directory. In either case, correct the local part of the file name."
	"Details: Note that path relative to a directory, such as '../../foo' are disallowed by this algorithm.  Also note that this method is tolerent of a nil argument -- is simply returns nil in this case."
